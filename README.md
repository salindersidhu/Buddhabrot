# Buddhabrot Fractal Generator

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge)](/LICENSE.md)

## Overview

This application generates a Buddhabrot fractal image in a PPM (Portable Pixel Map) file. The application provides several options to customize the fractal such as iterations for each colour channel, the number of samples to collect and the dimensions of the image. The generated PPM file can be viewed and edited using popular image editing software such as GIMP and Photoshop.

The first image was originally **1000 x 1000 pixels** generated using **20 iterations** per colour channel at **50 samples** per channel. The image size was 1.33 MB.

The second image was originally **8000 x 8000 pixels** generated using **4000 iterations** per colour channel at **500 samples** per channel. The image size was 513 MB!
